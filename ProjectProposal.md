From moodle description:

_In the proposal, you need to be more specific about the tools you plan on using. If you are building a web application, you should sketch or storyboard the "screens" you'll be using. There are a number of free "wireframe" applications ( https://www.creativebloq.com/wireframes/top-wireframing-tools-11121302 ) and one is free ( https://wireframe.cc/ ) but you can also using the Drawing app in the https://coding.csel.io system._

_You should also specify what SQL interface you're doing to use -- reviewing the "SQL in four acts" may be useful. For most of you, I would expect either the SQLAlchemy "raw" interface or the SQL object interface to be the easiest choice._

_Lastly, you should insure you have access to your data and access to a database. You can use the course MySQL database server or access Google credits or db4free.net_
